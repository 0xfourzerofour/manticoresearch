Therefore, I need to set the parameters for the development of the course because in this stage, I have to determine what students would be able to do as they take this course. Therefore, I should set the learning outcomes of the course. In order to evaluate these outcomes in later stage, it is often best to use “action verbs” to state what you want students to learn (learning outcomes) because they are based on observable actions.\r\n2.\tThe development and implementation stage: During this stage, I create the course content (course description and topics), and I look for the best alternative teaching strategies (.e.g., slide presentations, class discussions, essay projects...) to help my students meet the goals of the course through the activities that I will provide them with . I might spend a lot of time preparing slide presentations and other course resources, but setting the assessment methods (.e.g., assignments, quizzes, projects, midterm, and final exams...) it is a very important task for the course development.\r\n3.\tThe Evaluation Stage: The goal of this stage is to examine information that indicates the extent to which the teaching and learning practices led to achieve the learning outcomes. This last step involves consideration of a whole range of issues, including assumptions about teaching and learning, as well as issues related to the results of the decisions made at each of the previous steps. Also, as my course comes to an end, a survey (student evaluation) done by the Quality office (QO) might give me additional information about what “worked” or “did not work” and what kind of adjustments that I would alter to the future version of my course."",""q_1909"":""Interactive whiteboard, blackboard/LMS access, e-podium, flipped Classroom, projectors and slides"",""q_1981"":34598262,""q_1911"":3,""referrer_source"":"""",""q_1912"":""During my University teaching experience as an assistant professor, I had the opportunity to use technology extensively in my instruction, especially at King Faisal University.\r\nSince joining the College of Business Administration at King Faisal University in 2014, I have used several technologies; classrooms had interactive whiteboards, LCD projector, a blackboard, a laserdisc player, and a Saudi Digital library for data collection were available. I constantly thought of alternative ways to enhance my Economics lessons by integrating technology into appropriate curricular contexts. For example, In the principles macroeconomics course, I realized that some students would have difficulty understanding the difference between the real GDP and nominal GDP and how to avoid the impact of inflation in the calculation of economic growth rate witch typically difficult concepts for learners to understand. Therefore, I applied the flipped classroom, in which the conventional notion of classroom-based learning is inverted. In other words, before beginning the lecture, I used to send my students ,through the blackboard, the necessary materials (about the real GDP and nominal GDP) such as recorded lectures, curated videos, reading assignments, video broadcasts, while the in-class time was re-purposed for inquiry, application, and assessment in order to better meet the needs of individual learners. Therefore, my students were actively engaged in the lesson instead of being passive recipients."",""q_1913"":1,""q_1914"":""I believe that service is an important com"
